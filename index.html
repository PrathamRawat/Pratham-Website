        <p>
            Hi! I'm Pratham, a current Freshman at Stony Brook University with a passion for Software Development and Finance, currently pursuing a Computer Science major. Aside from schoolwork, I work on a number of personal projects in a number of different fields. I also am lucky be a Software Engineering intern at <a href="https://cryptonomic.tech">Cryptonomic</a>, a blockchain and fintech startup working towards a decentralized future. I am excited to continue working in Fin-Tech as I learn and grow more, both inside and outside the classroom!

        <h3 class="box-title">Software Engineer Intern @ Cryptonomic</h3>
        <p>
            Working closely with experienced developers, innovative designers and numerous offshore employees and contractors. I am responsible for developing insightful and usable projects surrounding Cryptonomic's product suite of blockchain and cryptocurrency user and developer tools in the rapid project turnaround time that a startup needs to function. I've developed production-ready code for visualizing blockchain data for use by users, investors, and data analysts (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/diving-deeper-into-tezos-cryptonomics-new-network-dashboard-periscope-154e86f0c4f8">Periscope</a>), and developed scripts for deploying containerized blockchain node infrastructure and containerized versions of Cryptonomic's own tool suite for use by smart-contract developers and users alike (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/managing-local-tezos-infrastructure-with-nautilus-core-304e924ca0de">Nautilus Core</a>). I have also conducted research on a variety of cryptocurrency supply statistics, optimized SQL queries on blockchain data, managed , and smart contract development standards.

        <p>
            I served on my <a href="https://stuypulse.org">High School Robotics Team</a> for four years in both a development and leadership capacity. As a member of the Software Engineering Department, I developed <a href="https://github.com/StuyPulse">code</a> in Java for the robot, and researched Computer Vision, PID tuning, and other control systems. Under my leadership as Vice President and President, I managed the 25-person Software Engineering Department to research Motion Profiling as well as additional control with PID and CV. I also managed the logistics of the 100+ person team at large and helped to plan events and mentor other teams.
