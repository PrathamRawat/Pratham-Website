        <p>
            Hello! I'm Pratham Rawat, a sophomore at Cornell University pursuing a career in software development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have a passion for building meaningful software in a fast paced environment! I have experience with entrepreneurship, leadership, and software engineering at a fundamental level through my own startup, professional internships, and multiple school clubs. I have experience with all stages of the software development life cycle, but am mostly interested in backend and analytical work. I also have experience with the Agile development methodology, JIRA, and working in a large corporate setting. I hope to leverage my experience in traditional software development alongside strong mathematics, leadership, and analytical skills to write software that is not only technically impressive, but serves a meaningful purpose.        </p>

        <h5 class="box-title">June 2021 - August 2021</h5>
        <p>
            My role as a Software Engineer at Fidelity had me working closely with the Application Security team, which works to secure all of Fidelity's vast suite of products and platforms. Working in an Agile development environment, I wrote automations to help management teams understand the work that subteams were completing. I worked with the JIRA API to build robust data analytics tools from JIRA tickets. I also researched different software vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them, and different software tools for managing credentials at scale. At the end of my internship, I developed a slide deck and presented my research findings and software projects to senior management.

        <h5 class="box-title">July 2019 - June 2021</h5>
        <p>
            Working closely with experienced developers, innovative designers and numerous offshore employees and contractors. I was responsible for developing insightful and usable projects surrounding Cryptonomic's product suite of blockchain and cryptocurrency user and developer tools in the rapid project turnaround time that a startup needs to function. I've developed production-ready code for visualizing blockchain data for use by users, investors, and data analysts (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/diving-deeper-into-tezos-cryptonomics-new-network-dashboard-periscope-154e86f0c4f8">Periscope</a>), and developed scripts for deploying containerized blockchain node infrastructure and containerized versions of Cryptonomic's own tool suite for use by smart-contract developers and users alike (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/managing-local-tezos-infrastructure-with-nautilus-core-304e924ca0de">Nautilus Core</a>). I also worked with Tunica, an NYC based art studio to develop <a href="https://reloaded.fun">Reloaded</a>, a curated NFT gallery, build in robust React-native, Typescript, and backed by self-authored smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. I have also conducted research on a variety of cryptocurrency supply statistics, optimized SQL queries on blockchain data, and developed smart contracts.

            Stock Market AI using Google Trends
        </h3>
        <p>
            I've always been interested in what can be gleaned from our aggregate search data. Using the percent change in search volume of various different search terms that generally have some financial connection, I hope to create a Deep-Q Reinforcement Learning model using search volume to determine when to buy and sell S&P 500 shares.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a big work in progress. Downloading Google Trends Data to train the model off of is a pain! This is also a self taught attempt at programming an AI model, using Tensorflow and miscellaneous online resources.

            Gen Z Meme Maker
        </h3>
        <p>
            Modern memes have gotten increasingly randomized! This was a quick 30-minute project I threw together on a whim as a humorous critique of what humor has become. The app grabs a random image and random english word, and puts them together to create a simple, yet often riotous meme.
