        <p>
            Hi! I'm Pratham, a current Freshman at Stony Brook University with a passion for meaningful Software Development, currently pursuing a Computer Science major. Aside from schoolwork, I work on a number of personal projects in a number of different fields. I also am lucky be a Software Engineering intern at <a href="https://cryptonomic.tech">Cryptonomic</a>, a blockchain and fintech startup working towards a decentralized future. I am excited to continue coding I learn and grow more, both inside and outside the classroom!

        <h5 class="box-title">2019 - Present</h5>
        <p>
            Working closely with experienced developers, innovative designers and numerous offshore employees and contractors. I am responsible for developing insightful and usable projects surrounding Cryptonomic's product suite of blockchain and cryptocurrency user and developer tools in the rapid project turnaround time that a startup needs to function. I've developed production-ready code for visualizing blockchain data for use by users, investors, and data analysts (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/diving-deeper-into-tezos-cryptonomics-new-network-dashboard-periscope-154e86f0c4f8">Periscope</a>), and developed scripts for deploying containerized blockchain node infrastructure and containerized versions of Cryptonomic's own tool suite for use by smart-contract developers and users alike (deployed as <a href="https://medium.com/the-cryptonomic-aperiodical/managing-local-tezos-infrastructure-with-nautilus-core-304e924ca0de">Nautilus Core</a>). I have also conducted research on a variety of cryptocurrency supply statistics, optimized SQL queries on blockchain data, managed , and smart contract development standards.

        <h5 class="box-title">2016 - 2020</h5>
        <p>
            I served on my <a href="https://stuypulse.org">High School Robotics Team</a> for four years in both a development and leadership capacity. As a member of the Software Engineering Department, I developed <a href="https://github.com/StuyPulse">code</a> in Java for the robot, and researched Computer Vision, PID tuning, and other control systems. Under my leadership as Vice President and President, I managed the 25-person Software Engineering Department to research Motion Profiling as well as additional control with PID and CV. I also managed the logistics of the 100+ person team at large and helped to plan events and mentor other teams.

            Stock Market AI using Google Trends
        </h3>
        <p>
            I've always been interested in what can be gleaned from our aggregate search data. Using the percent change in search volume of various different search terms that generally have some financial connection, I hope to create a Deep-Q Reinforcement Learning model using search volume to determine when to buy and sell S&P 500 shares.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a big work in progress. Downloading Google Trends Data to train the model off of is a pain! This is also a self taught attempt at programming an AI model, using Tensorflow and miscellaneous online resources.
